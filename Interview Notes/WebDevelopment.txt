Local Storage VS Session Storage VS Cookies

-   Local Storage:
    1. This storage is supported by many browsers.
    2. The local storage works the same as a hash-map due to the <Key, Value> pair.
    3. Providing greater storage capacity (improvement on cookies), available size is 5MB.
    4. Data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request - reduce the amount
       of traffic between Client and Server.
    5. Data within the local storage will stay available until it is explicitly deleted.
    6. Changes made will be available for all current and future access to the site.
    7. Works on the same-origin policy. Data stored will only available on the same origin (PC).

-   Session Storage:
    1. Similar to Local Storage.
    2. Changes are only available per window (Tab in browsers). Changes made by the user
       are saved and available for current page, as well as future visits to the site on the
       same browser window/tab.
    3. Exist until the browser window/tab is closed. Once closed, session storage data is deleted.
       The data is not persistent once the tab is closed.
    4. The data only available inside the window/tab in which it was set.
    5. Works on the same-origin policy. Data stored will only available on the same origin (PC).

-   Cookies:
    1. Cookie expiration time can be set.
    2. The capacity of storage is only 4KB which is including name, value, expiry date, etc.
    3. The data is sent back to the server for every HTTP request - increase the amount
       of traffic between Client and Server.
