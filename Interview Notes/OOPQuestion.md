# Basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming:
## Abstraction:
Abstraction enable to use multiple inheritance, with the access of abstraction can hide important data and show only important data to show user.

## Polymorphism:
Use one form into multiple forms.

## Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a subset of abstraction that can restrict user to show data with the use of encapsulation.
